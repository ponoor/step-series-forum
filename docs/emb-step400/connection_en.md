## Wiring the power source
### Power source voltage
Supply power for the electromagnetic brake. Many EM brakes use 24V, but please refer to the datasheet of your motor.

### Power supply terminal
There are two types of power supply terminals: the DC barrel jack and the Euro-style terminal block. As these are connected on the PCB, **DO NOT SUPPLY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME**

#### DC jack

- Outer diameter 5.5mm
- Inner diameter 2.1mm
- Center positive

#### Euro-style terminal block
A 3.81mm pitch, 2pin Euro-style terminal block is built-in. Refer to the polarity described on the PC for connecting your DC supply correctly. [![](https://ponoor.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brake-power-700x525.jpg)](https://ponoor.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brake-power.jpg)

## Connecting the brake
Connect the wires from the EM brake's terminal block to the corresponding motor. Note how each terminal on the brake is numbered just like the STEP400--make sure these match in terms of wiring.

Like most EM brakes, this brake has a polarity requirement, so wire your motor as stated on the PCB.

## Connecting the STEP400
Connect the STEP400 using the provided 6-pin ribbon cable.
