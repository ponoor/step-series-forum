### About the driving current

According the [datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/Winsok-Semicon-WSF28N06_C148431.pdf) of the switching MOSFET, the rating is 60V @ 28A. However, the actual rating is limited to the rating of the power source terminal block which is 7A. Within this range, you can control other loads like LEDs or motors.
