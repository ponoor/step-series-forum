### `/homing (int)motorID`
#### Argument
| Argument | Range | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| motorID | 1-4/1-8, 255 | Motor ID |

#### Executable timing
Always

#### Description
Start the homing movement. Move towards origin direction, stop when the HOME switch is activated. Then the motor reverses the direction and move slowly, halts when the HOME sensor is not active anymore, then reset location to zero at the current point.

This is equivalent to the following actions of executing [`/goUntil`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#gountil_intmotorid_boolact_floatspeed) command, and after the motor stops on HOME sensor activation, execute [`/releaseSW`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#releasesw_intmotorid_boolact_booldir) command.

The `homingDirection` and the `homingSpeed` can be set by [`/setHomingDirection`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#sethomingdirection_intmotorid_booldirection)and [`/setHomingSpeed`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#sethomingspeed_intmotorid_floatspeed) commands, as well as configuring from the configTool.

Time-out can be set for each of the `/goUntil` and `/releaseSw` commands. The controller halts the motor movement if the sensor state have not changed during this time frame. The time-out values can be set from [`/setGoUntilTimeout`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#setgountiltimeout_intmotorid_inttimeout) and from [`setReleaseSwTimeout`](https://ponoor.com/en/docs/step-series/osc-command-reference/homing/#setreleaseswtimeout_intmotorid_inttimeout) command.

Depending on the state change on the homing movement, following response will be sent.
