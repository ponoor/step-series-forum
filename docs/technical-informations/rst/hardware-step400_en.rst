======== ================= ==========

Since the PowerSTEP01_RESET and W5500_RESET are connected to the reset
pins of PowerSTEP01 and W5500 individually, be sure to set pinMode to
OUTPUT and then set the state to HIGH.

=====================
Pads on PCB rear side
=====================

There are unassigned pins and power pads on the rear side of PCB. They
are 2.54mm picth, so you can attach surface-mount pin-headers and IC
sockets. R35 and R36 on the rear side can be used for the pull-up for
the i2c pins(SDA, SDL). The chip size is 1608(0603).

Since these pins are not controlled from firmware, customizing firmware
for your own purpose is necessary.

**************
SPI assignment
**************

For the STEP400, different SPI ports are used for the PowerSTEP01 and
W5500 for the ease of firmware process. Here is a very informative guide
to SPI allocation in ATSAMD21.

PowerSTEP01
***********

=====
Clock
=====

A 16MHz crystal oscillator is connected to the OSCIN of Motor ID 1’s
PowerSTEP01. From there, OSCOUT and OSCIN are daisy chained in order of
IDs, so please set each PowerSTEP01 to “External 16MHz input, Inverted
output(``EXT_16MHZ_OSCOUT_INVERT``)”. If the internal clock is used, the
movement may shift gradually during constant speed operation.

***********************************************************
Unavailable PowerSTEP01 features due to the hardware design
***********************************************************

====
STCK
====

Since it is not wired, Step Clock operation is not possible.

=====
ADCIN
=====

This is used for the limit sensor inputs, therefore not used for the
original supply voltage compensation featue. Be sure to disable
UVLO_ADC, which will raise the alarm based on the value of the ADC
input.
