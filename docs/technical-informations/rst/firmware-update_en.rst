*********************
Updating the firmware
*********************

The firmware may be updated for bugfixes and adding features.

Please check the current firmware version on the controller first, then
if it’s older than `the version published on Github`_, please update the
firmware.

*****************************************************
Checking firmware version burned on to the controller
*****************************************************

One method is to check the over the OSC through ethernet. Another method
is to check from serial monitor over USB.

==============
Check over OSC
==============

With ``/getVersion`` message you can check the current firmware version.
For detail, please command reference for `/getVersion`_.

----------------
Response example
----------------

::

   /version "STEP800_R1_UNIVERSAL 1.0.1 Mar 24 2022 11:17:29"

==============
Check from USB
==============

Connect STEP400 and your PC with USB cable, send ``s`` from serial
monitor. From the response message, you can obtain the firmware version.
See more detail for `Diagnosis via USB serial port`_ under `Firmware`_
section.

   -------------- Firmware --------------
   Firmware name : STEP800_R1_UNIVERSAL
   Firmware version : 1.0.1
   Compile date : Mar 24 2022, 11:17:29

************************************
To check the latest firmware version
************************************

Check the latest firmware version from the “`Releases`_” of the Github
repository of STEP-Series.

Previously, STEP400 and STEP800 firmware was managed in separate
repositories, but as of March 2022, we have moved to a unified
“STEP-series Universal Firmware”. The version numbers have been reset
accordingly, so please follow the procedure below to make sure you have
the latest version.

1. Check if ``UNIVERSAL`` is in the name of the firmware obtained from
   the controller.
2. If no, the firmware in the controller is old and need to update
3. If yes, compare with the version number of “`Releases`_”.

*****************
Updating firmware
*****************

If the firmware on the controller is old, please update the firmware.
The update can be done by compiling and uploading latest firmware sketch
from Arduino IDE. Refer `Compiling Arduino sketch`_ for more detail.
